Hello, I have been on to this for about 3 days to just make the copied code working. Here are some Instructions to make your process easier.

I have added all the files required for running the code

1. Install python (Check create path file option if you r on windows)
2. Install selenium using pip command on cmd (windows)
3. There are diferent drivers for opening Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc. Make sure u have installed these files correctly

To use Firefox install Gecko Driver, Download Gecko Driver
Add the location to your path list
To use Chrome install Chrome Driver, Download Chrome Driver
Add the location to your path list 

Steps to Add a Path in Systemâ€™s PATH Environmental Variable

    On Windows system right click on My Computer or This PC.
    Select Properties.
    Select advanced system settings.
    Click on the Environment Variables button.
    From System Variables select PATH.
    Click on Edit button.
    Click New button
    Paste the path of GeckoDriver file.
    Click OK.
    
    
For mac and ubuntu users use brew or curl command to install Geckodriver, Chromedriver, etc.
For all OS these steps are same :
 1. install python
 2. pip install selenium
